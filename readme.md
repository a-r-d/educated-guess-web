Educated Guess (WEB)
===================

#What:
	
	Takes a seed list things you know about target. 
	E.g. name, school, address, birthdate and then 
	crosses it with a list of other passwords. I have 
	provided some lists of common terrible passwords.
	It will then output a customized password attempt 
	list to a location of your choosing.
    
    
#Original Project:

    A command line Ruby script. I decided to re-write using Sinatra, so I could
    deploy the thing easily and play with the framework. I'm a big fan of Flask.
